RAYNET CRM Integration
======================

This repository serve as a reference implementation for some of the API you can
use to integrate external systems with RAYNET CRM (https://raynetcrm.com). Each
example is contained in a separate folder.

We recommend to use the class *Raynetcrm*, which serves as a simple
communication facade to the RAYNET CRM API. 

Requirements
------------

* PHP 5 (tested with PHP 5.5, altough older should also work)
* Curl PHP extension
* Admin user account with API key (Users' profile -> Change security -> Reset
	new API key)
